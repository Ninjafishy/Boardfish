## Features

- An infinite canvas free from formatting rules
- Lag-free navigation across massive boards supporting 500 MB of images and text
- Losslessly add images via clipboard, drag and drop, or the file picker
- Multi-select, translate, scale, flip, rotate, copy, paste, and duplicate
- Export one image, selected images, or all images
- Losslessly copy images back to your clipboard
- Save everything locally as a portable .bf file
- Pin the editable board above other windows with Document Picture-in-Picture in supported desktop browsers

To pin a board, right-click an empty area and choose **Pin Board**. Keep the
original tab open while working in the floating window. Close the floating
window or choose **Return to Tab** to bring the board back with its changes and
undo history intact. Reloading or closing the original tab ends the session.
Chrome controls the floating window's size and placement; fullscreen behavior
depends on the browser and operating system.
